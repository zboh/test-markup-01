## test-markup-01

after learning HTML/CSS for couple of months and participating in one comertial project, 
I've decided to endoll for a marckup-dev job offer. 

This design was a test to prove I was qualified for job. 
It took me 31:39:33 to finish this markup. 
_(please, take in consideration: prior to this job-test, I wasn't practising markup for about 4 months,
so I had to re-investigare several concepts)_

All rights on this design belong to it's creators.
(I've left original copyright mark which I found in design file)

Several things to fix:
- [x] I've found an text-rotate issue on chrome (i'm on macOS)
- [x] problem with news-cards to fix
- [x] minor respons. fixes to be done
- [x] menu items linked to diff page segments
